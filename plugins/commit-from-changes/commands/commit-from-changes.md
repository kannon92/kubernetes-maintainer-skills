## Name

commit-from-changes:commit-from-changes

## Synopsis

Stage and commit changes with a Kubernetes-style commit message.

## Description

Generates a commit for the current changes following Kubernetes commit message conventions. Stages all changes if nothing is staged, reviews the diff, and produces a properly formatted commit message.

## Implementation

Generate a commit for the current changes following these rules:

1. Run `git diff --cached --stat` and `git diff --stat` to understand what has changed. If nothing is staged, stage all changes with `git add -A`.
2. Run `git diff --cached` to review the full staged diff.
3. Generate a commit message in Kubernetes style:
   - Subject line: start with a capitalized imperative verb (e.g., Fix, Add, Update, Remove, Refactor)
   - Subject line should be concise (under 72 characters) and describe WHAT changed
   - If the change is scoped to a specific component or package, prefix with it (e.g., "pkg/controller: Fix race condition in queue processing")
   - Add a blank line after the subject
   - Body should explain WHY the change was made if not obvious from the subject
   - Wrap body lines at 72 characters
4. NEVER include the word "claude" anywhere in the commit message
5. NEVER use special characters like # @ ! $ % ^ & * in the commit message
6. Show the generated commit message to the user and ask for approval before committing
7. Commit with the approved message using `git commit`
